    "\n",
    "A **virtual environment** is an isolated Python environment that allows you to:\n",
    "- Keep project dependencies separate from system-wide packages\n",
    "- Avoid version conflicts between different projects\n",
    "- Make projects more reproducible for others\n",
    "\n",
    "Using virtual environments is a **best practice** in Python development, especially when working on AI, machine learning, and data science projects.\n",

    "## Step 1: Checking Python Version\n",
    "Before creating a virtual environment, check if Python is installed and which version you are using. Open a terminal and execute the following command:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "python --version\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Most students are probably working with Python 3.10 or higher now. Sometimes the latest Python releases aren't yet fully supported for all packages. For now, 3.13 is not recommended for this course. You can still have Python 3.13 installed on your machine, but select an earlier version for your venv.\n",

    "## Step 2: Creating a Virtual Environment\n",
    "You can create a virtual environment using the built-in `venv` module. These instructions assume you're working in the terminal. However, you may recall, it's also possible to create a virtual environment using the VS Code interface.\n",

    "This will create a folder called `venv/` that contains a clean Python installation. You can chance 'venv' in the examples above to any other name if you wish. For example, here it might make sense to name it ai-venv. You can also add a `.` in front of the name `.venv` or `.ai-venv` to create a hidden folder. Some developers prefer to keep it hidden so the project folder is cleaner.\n",
